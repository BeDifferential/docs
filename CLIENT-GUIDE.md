# DIFFERENTIAL DEV SHOP CLIENT GUIDE

*This document describes common questions and pitfalls
of software development, and how we work to mitigate them. We have developed a process
called the "4D Development Process" to guide us through and have found great success with it*

## (DISCOVERY) Becoming our client

*The DISCOVERY phase is to understand and analyze the core problem you want to solve,
understanding what assumptions you're making, while brainstorming a variety of
potential solutions. We want to know why you're building this, and want makes you unique.*

### How do I get in touch?

We love email! Send us an email at hello@differential.io with a brief
description of your project and how you see us working with you.

### Understanding the project

After we have read you're email, we will setup a time to talk with you. We will want to
find out why you are building what you're building, what makes it (and you) special,
why you think we are the right fit, and anything else that you feel is important.

### Wait, before I tell you my idea, would you please sign my NDA

While we appreciate the intent of signing an NDA (and we take confidentiality seriously),
we do not sign NDA's. Here is a blog post describing why we think [you don't need an NDA]( http://differential.io/blog/why-you-dont-need-an-nda). We have language protecting you in our
MSA (Master Services Agreement), along with the fact that we are not in the business of
stealing ideas. If we were, we wouldn't be in business long.

The main reasons we don't sign NDA's before we hear an idea:
* We talk with entrepreneurs everyday and hear 1,000s of ideas a year
* Maintaining organization and clarity of whose ideas are what is a legal
and liability nightmare for our business (especially since you might not end up
being a customer)

How we can discuss your idea without an NDA:
* Don't tell us anything that you consider "secret sauce" or don't feel comfortable sharing
* Because we see a lot of ideas, we can probably get a pretty good grasp without a ton of detail

There are exceptions to every rule, and we do realize that some of our corporate innovation clients, with 100+ person legal teams, may not have a choice. 

### Decision to move forward

After better understand your project and learning more about you and your goals, we will 
work to put together an estimate for you.

### Receiving an estimate

Now that we have a good understanding of what you want to build, we will write a short (one to two page)
document describing:

* How we understand your product
* Feature list
* Required investment and invoicing terms

Sometimes ideas are too vague or too large in scope for us to set project price. In this case,
we have options:

* We can (and often do) work in phases using blocks of hours working against a top priorities list
* We can choose a subset of the full feature list

### How much does software cost?

How much does building a custom house cost? It depends on what you want,
and how refined the details are (are you building a barn or a luxury mansion).

Our projects range from five-page marketing sites to fully-developed 3D applications. 
So somewhere between $x,xxx and $xxx,xxx.
Our sweet spot (entrepreneurs building out their first early version of their product) have
budgets in the mid 5 figures.

### How long does it take?

Most of our MVP applications take about 8 to 10 weeks to deliver functional,
working software but is dependent on the project and how many changes
happen over the duration of the project.

### What do I get?

We will act as your software development partner. That means we will act like your product is
our product. We will make arguments for some features we should have and for features that we
should not build. We are building the functioning product and make sure that we deploy the product
in an environment where it can grow, and handle expected traffic.

We use source control (Github), which ensures that if we make coding errors, we can roll back easilty to working versions. While you are our partner, you will have access to our startup network
(including investors, advisors, developers, and industry experts).

## (DEFINE) What happens after I say "yes" to Differential?

*The DEFINE phase is to narrow down the best solution, defining the project
scope and features, and then assign appropriate team members and resources.*

### You might have to wait a little

We are busy (which is great because it means we have projects to work on
that we care about) but it can mean that we won't be able to start your project right away.
We usually kickoff projects within two weeks of a signed agreement.

### We define and redefine what we should build next

Based on our estimate, our team will create a Trello board with our version of the priority list
of items to work on. These will be the highest technical risk areas (and our approach to understand them).
We will also create a list of items that we will need from you before we can begin the work. Some of the
items will include branding elements (like logos and colors) but will also have items like copy for the pages
on the list. We will share this list at the kickoff meeting

### We schedule a kickoff meeting

A kickoff meeting is our turn to discuss our plan with you and get your feedback on what should
be priority. We will walk you through our project tracking tool (and your role in it). We will
walk through what information we are still waiting on from you and make sure we are on the
same page.

### We schedule a start date

Within two weeks (sometimes the day after) of the kickoff meeting, we will begin work. The
start date allows you to know when you should start expecting updates and start seeing results.

## (DEVELOP) What happens when the work begins?

*The DEVELOP phase is where we'll begin implementing code through sprints,
prioritizing features with our riskiest technical challenges first.*

### Who will do the work

In the DEFINITION phase we learned enough about what we are building to define
the correct resources for the work. You will have one main project contact who will act
as your product manager. They will:

* Coach you through the progress we are making
* Stay on top of the budget
* Let you know how changes will affect the duration and overall cost of the project
* Modulate resources in and out of your project

### We'll iterate with working software

Within the first few days we will have an software deployed to a server that you can see.
You will be able to see progress and updates made every couple days.

Along with the live code, you will be able to follow along (and input into) our project tracking
software (Trello) where you can see first hand at what is currently under development.

Your input will be vital in prioritizing the feature set throughout the project.

### How you stay involved

We value transparency of in our relationship so we use, share, and communicate through
a project tracking software (often times Trello), which allows you to stay involved
without losing important information in email.

Here's how we suggest you staying involved (and what we've seen work best):

1. For any changes or new feature suggestions that you definitely want; add those to our project software. That way:

  * they'll get knocked out once they surface as a priority
  * it's easier to consider them against other to-dos
  * it keeps the team focused on building (not emailing back & forth about new feature ideas)

Definitely OK to just bounce thoughts/ideas off of us if you're not sure, but we suggest you hold those for our regular calls, when possible.

2. Keep in mind that what might seem like "small changes" can end up taking hours. For example, something we see with
many clients is the tendency to want to tweak the homepage (based on gut feel, not user
feedback), even before we build the meat & potatoes.

3. When you do have strong opinions about stuff (which is OK, we realize some things are worth extra time/effort), try to
provide as detailed direction as you can, as early as possible. For example if you have a clear vision for what the design
of a page should be, sharing that as early as possible will help limit the amount of time the team has to put in.

### Setting up source control, hosting, analytics.

We set up as a standard practice:

* Source control (Github)
* Hosting (Modulus)
* Basic analytics (Google Analytics)

## (DEBUG) What happens after launch?

*The DEBUG phase is everything after we design and implement the planned features.
we'll begin testing with real users, iterating on feedback, suggestions and bug reports.*

### Disappointment (bet you weren't expecting us to say that!)

Since we are working with working software, there isn't a magic switch and
feeling of the lights turning on for the first time when we "go live". Software launches
aren't big parties anymore, and you shouldn't expect a flood of users.
You (and us) have spent many hours, blood, sweat, and tears making a great product. We should
all be proud of that. The hard work just begins once we start having real users of the product.

### Bugs Will Surface

Even the most astute quality assurance processes can't find all the issues with software
until real users start using your product. That is why we maintain 20% of the budget
in a "shared account" so that we can handle post-launch activities. If we are working on
a monthly billing plan, plan to have a budget for post-launch.

### Users Will Have Good Feature Requests

Since we all work on the web these days, everyone and their brother has thoughts about
what software should do. Some of these ideas are great, and some are terrible. The best thing
to do is to set a timeframe (we recommend two weeks) before you add new features to the queue.
That way, you make these decisions with a clear mind and data vs. emotion.

### Software Will Need Ongoing Support

Software is never done. There is always something to work on and improve. Expect that
there will be a list of things to work on after the project is complete. New bugs will be
introduced when new technology emerges (new screen sizes, new browsers, new operating systems, etc).
At a minimum there is some amount of work to keep the current functionality operational.

## (THE END) How does our relationship end?

*there are a few reasons why our relationship will end, and we like to plan for it in advance*

### Funding has dried up

Too often, we are working with entrepreneurs on an MVP with the goal of acquiring
capital from investors, and those investors get cold feet. Many on our team have
been through that. When it does happen, let's have an honest conversation, and
make a plan to leave the code in a spot where we can pick up again with minimal restart effort,
when funding is available.

### You decided to shut the project down

After months of missed user acquisition goals, some clients make the decision to shut down the project.
Let us know and we will be able to turn off all charged services so you won't incur ongoing costs.

### Bringing on a new developer

While we would love to be your long term development partner, sometimes it makes sense to
bring someone in house. We are honest in that we are not going to be your cheapest long term option.
It is important that we know in advance that a change will be occurring so that we can make
sure that documentation is in order for the new developer to take over.

## (OTHER)

### What some of our existing clients had to say

We love our clients, and our clients love us too. Our past and existing
clients have been our best advocates. Please ask us if you would like references.
