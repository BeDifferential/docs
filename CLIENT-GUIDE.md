# DIFFERENTIAL DEV SHOP CLIENT GUIDE

*Below is our client guide. It describes some commonly asked questions and pitfalls
of software development and how we work to mitigate them. We have developed a process
called the "4D Development Process" to guide us through and have found great success with it*

## (DISCOVERY) Becoming our client

*The DISCOVERY phase is to understand and analyze the core problem you want to solve,
understanding what assumptions you're making, while brainstorming a variety of
potential solutions. We want to know why you're building this, and want makes you unique.*

### How do I get in touch?

We love email! Send us an email at hello@differential.io with a brief
description of your project and how you see us working with you.

### Understanding the project

TODO

### Receiving an estimate

TODO

### How much do you cost?

TODO

### How long does it take?

TODO

### What do I get?

TODO

## (DEFINE) What happens after I say "yes" to Differential?

*The DEFINE phase is to narrow down the best solution, defining the project
scope and features, and then assign appropriate team members and resources.*

### You might have to wait a little

TODO

### We schedule a kickoff meeting

TODO

### We define and redefine what we are going to build first

TODO - highest technical risks, wireframes and branding

### We schedule a start date

TODO

## (DEVELOP) What happens when the work begins?

*The DEVELOP phase is where we'll begin implementing code through sprints,
prioritizing features with our riskiest technical challenges first.*

### Who will do the work

TODO - In the definition phase we learned enough about what we are building to define
the correct resources for the work. You will have one main project contact who will act
as your product manager. They will help coach you through the progress that is being made,
they will stay on top of the budget and will let you know how changes you are suggesting
will affect the duration and overall cost of the project. The product manager will also be
responsible for modulating the correct resources in and out of your project.

### We'll iterate with working software

TODO - briefly describe how we incorporate agile development

### How you stay involved

We value transparency of in our relationship so we use, share, and communicate through
a project tracking software (often times Trello), which allows you to stay very involved
without losing important information in email.

Here's how we suggest you staying involved (and what we've seen work best):

1. For any changes or new feature suggestions that you definitely want; add those to our project software. That way;
  * they'll get knocked out once they surface as a priority
  * it's easier to consider them against other to-dos
  * it keeps the team focused on building (not emailing back & forth about new feature ideas)

   Definitely OK to just bounce thoughts/ideas off of us if you're not sure, but we suggest you hold those for our regular
calls, when possible.

2. Keep in mind that what might seem like "small changes" can end up taking hours. For example, something we see with
many clients we work with is the tendency to want to continually tweak the homepage (based on gut feel, not user
feedback), even before the meat & potatoes are built.

3. When you do have strong opinions about stuff (which is OK, we realize some things are worth extra time/effort), try to
provide as detailed direction as you can, as early as possible. For example if you have a clear vision for what the design
of a page should be, sharing that as early as possible will help limit the amount of time the team has to put in.

### Setting up source control, hosting, analytics.

We will handle setting up source control (Github), hosting (Modulus), and basic analytics (Google Analytics)
for all of our clients as a standard practice.

## (DEBUG) What happens after launch?

*The DEBUG phase is everything after the planned features are designed and implemented.
we'll begin testing with real users, iterating on feedback, suggestions and bug reports.*

### Disappointment (bet you weren't expecting us to say that!)

TODO - Since we are constantly working with working software, there isn't a magic switch and
feeling of the lights turning on for the first time when we "go live". Software launches
aren't big parties anymore, and an inrush of users isn't to be expected.
You (and us) have spent many hours, blood, sweat, and tears making a great product. We should
all be proud of that.

### Bugs Will Surface

TODO - even the most astute quality assurance processes can't find all the issues with software
until real users start using your product. That is why we maintain 20% of the budget
in a "shared account" so that we can prioritize post-launch activities.


### Users Will Have Feature Requests (that you want to implement)

TODO - Since we all work on the web these days, everyone and their brother has thoughts about
what software should do. Some of these ideas are great, and some are terrible. The best thing
to do is to set a timeframe (we recommend two weeks) before any new features are added to the queue.
That way, decisions are made with a clear mind and data vs. emotion.

### Software Will Need Ongoing Support

TODO - Software is never done. There is always something to work on and improve. Expect that
there will be a list of things to work on after the project is complete. New bugs will be
introduced when new technology (new screen sizes, new browsers, new operating systems, etc)
are implemented so at a minimum there is some amount of work to keep the current functionality
operational.

## (THE END) How does our relationship end?

*there are a few reasons why our relationship will end, and we like to plan for it in advance*

### Bringing on a new developer
TODO - while we would love to be your long term development partner, sometimes it's best for you
to leave the nest and bring on an internal developer. In those sec

### Funding has dried up

TODO - how we give you your code, train your developers on how we structure the app, etc

### You decided to shut the project down

TODO - how we eliminate or minimize ongoing cost, explain the risks of "stalled" software development
