# DIFFERENTIAL CLIENT GUIDE

## What happens after I say "yes" to Differential?

### You might have to wait a little

We're pretty awesome at what we do, so it might take us some time to
get your work into our schedule. We keep a very close eye on that schedule and strive to be extremely transparent with you. So yeah, it sucks to have to
wait, but it'll be worth it :)

### Who will do the work

There will be a single partner who is designated as your primary point of contact. The partners of Differential (employee-owners) drive all strategy and vision. To actually execute the work, we do a lot of it locally, but depending on work volume we also tap into development resources elsewhere in the U.S. and internationally. Rest assured that all the big decisions are made by the partners in Cincinnati, they will drive the vision for each user story, and we stand behind the work of our remote contributors.

### We'll iterate with working software

Building a MVP for a new product is a project with an "abundance" of
uncertainty. Some people try to mitigate that by doing a lot of
planning, writing a big spec document, talking, talking, talking...
Billing, billing, billing. We take a different approach.

We'll spend a tiny amount of time up-front building a queue of user stories (tasks based on the overall experience), and
choosing a batch to start on that if we delivered working software,
users could receive value by using it.

Then we will get working software in you and your users hands ASAP, and
deploy updates continuously. 

### How you stay involved

We LOVE clients who are super involved, not just up front, but throughout a project. In order to facilitate this, 
we use project tracking software (often times Trello), which allows our founders to stay very involved without bogging
down our developers in email. 

Here's how we suggest you staying involved (and what we've seen work best):

1. For any changes or new feature suggestions that you definitely want; add those to our project software. That way;
  * they'll get knocked out once they surface as a priority
  * it's easier to consider them against other to-dos
  * it keeps the team focused on building (not emailing back & forth about new feature ideas)

   Definitely OK to just bounce thoughts/ideas off of us if you're not sure, but we suggest you hold those for our regular 
calls, when possible.

2. Keep in mind that what might seem like "small changes" can end up taking hours. For example, something we see with 
many founders we work with is the tendency to want to continually tweak the homepage (based on gut feel, not user 
feedback), even before the meat & potatoes are built. 

   In general, we recommend you keep the 80/20 rule in mind. It's pretty rare to nail things out of the gate, anyhow, 
and it's also hard to tell how much additional impact many early changes might have in helping us validate the concept. 
Err on the side of getting things pretty good & letting users dictate how we improve from there.

3. When you do have strong opinions about stuff (which is OK, we realize some things are worth extra time/effort), try to 
provide as detailed direction as you can, as early as possible. For example if you have a clear vision for what the design
of a page should be, sharing that as early as possible will help limit the amount of time the team has to put in.

### Setting up source control, hosting, analytics, etc.

Once you're our client, we'll care about your business forever.

But we might not be your developer beyond the earliest days. We are
believers that once we uncover a market + product that people will pay
you for, it makes sense to recruit a team.

So we set everything up so it's easy for you to bring your new team
members into the project, and eventually removing us from those services
without having to incur a painful services switchover process.

## What happens after the MVP launches?

### Disappointment (bet you weren't expecting us to say that!)

We're a fan of [Pirate
Metrics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irjgfW0BIrw).

* Acquisition - how many users sign up
* Activation - how many users do enough intial activity to get value
  from your app
* Retention - do they come back? (you're app is going to suck at this at
  first. Everyone's does.)
* Referral - do they tell others (nope, not at first.)
* Revenue - how much money are you generating (this will be close to
  zero for some time, unfortunately.)

So you launch. More likely than not, most of the numbers above are zero (or close to zero). Now we iterate to fix this.

### Concierge your first paid users

You'll need to go out, identify some people who will pay you for a
concierge service using your product. These users will be the best
source of learning for all 5 of the pirate metrics.

This is all you — super, super important though, if you want to build a
product that has a chance to be successful.

### Social media/marketing and operations and fundraising support

We'll provide a some support intrinsicly. However, we can provide some
paid services for non-development/design work too if you're severly lacking. 

## Do you have traction?

Traction is tricky. Getting more visits to your site is nice, but
doesn't pay bills. And generating a dollar of revenue that costs you
$1.60 is not very cool either.

It's all a big guess, until you actually have a profitable business,
whether you will ultimately get there.

If we sense you're onto something big, we'll want to stay very involved,
help with phase 2, try to get some equity in your venture in exchange
for discounted billing rates, etc.

If we don't love the traction, we might decide to scale down our
involvement. WE WILL NOT ABANDON YOU, THOUGH. And we'll always be
friends and will offer advice and support. But we won't do equity deals
with products we don't believe in.
