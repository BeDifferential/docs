# DIFFERENTIAL GUIDEBOOK

*Dedicated to the families of our team.
Thank you for supporting our efforts to create an incredible company.*

*Special thanks to Valve, and their [amazing new employee handbook](http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf) which we started with as a base document, then modified. Please don't sue us, Gabe!*

## How we got started

In the fall of 2012, Tim and Ry asked the question "What if you took the 10 ideas and 30 people in a typical accelerator 'class' and combined them into one organization?" They believed it would reduce waste. Through natural selection, some ideas would die quick deaths, and the best few would attract the most talent. And investors would see a better return.

The vision for Differential has evolved some since that original question, but testing this theory is part of that vision. 

In 2013, Differential was founded by Tim, Ry, and Gerard as the company we plan to retire from. Our initial mission was to:
* Create a work environment we always dreamed of for ourselves, knowing that if we could make it awesome for us, it would also attract great talent.
* Support entrepreneurs and the Cincinnati startup ecosystem. 
* Create long-term value for our investors, our team, and our clients through aligning our interests with our clients by taking some of our compensation in equity.
* Help unlock talented technical folks from their safe jobs by creating opportunities that are less risky than the normal startup proposition.
* Build great products that are solving real problems.

We work differently than what you may be used to. You have no boss. You choose what to work on. Your peers control your compensation.

## Guiding Principles

### Ownership creates alignment.

* O1 We want equity in projects we work on.
* O2 We transparently share company equity with the team.

### Money matters.

* M1 We focus on projects that can generate revenue early.
* M2 Serious startups raise angel and venture financing when necessary.
* M3 Startup workers do not need to suffer financially; we believe it makes sense to take care of employees when possible, so they can focus on what matters.
* M4 Building a company cash reserve creates freedom.

### Flat hierarchy.

* F1 Nobody is told what to do; you don't have a boss. You choose what to work on.
* F2 Treating talented people like children obliterates their value.
* F3 You have the power to green-light projects and to ship products.
* F4 Flatness eliminates barriers between your work and customers enjoying your work.
* F5 Because everyone is a partner in the business, we trust them to make the right decisions; sometimes you'll work on projects because it's good for the long-term stability of YOUR business.

## What should you work on?

Deciding how to spend your time is very challenging. If you're
ambitious, you'll find yourself constantly looking around for the most valuable work you could be doing, and it's not always obvious what that is.

How much time should you spend in your core area of expertise? During a project, how far outside of that core area should you allow yourself to drift?

If you're technical, do you want to work on improving your non-technical skills? And vice-versa?

People are going to pull you towards their pet projects.

There may be times where you wistfully long for the days where you had just one person telling you what they think you should do, rather than everybody.

Some questions to guide you towards good work:

* What can I do to create the most benefit to our customers? Our business?
* Are we not doing something that we should be doing?
* What’s interesting?
* What’s rewarding?
* What leverages my strengths?

Our lack of a traditional structure comes with an important
responsibility. It’s up to all of us to spend effort focusing on the
long-term goals of the company.

For every task you decide to work on, there will be dozens that aren’t
getting your attention. You've got to make judgement calls. Nobody expects you to devote time to every opportunity that comes your way.

## How does the company decide what to work on?

The same way we make other decisions: by waiting for someone to decide that it’s the right thing to do, and then letting them recruit other people to work on it with them.

We believe in each other to make these decisions, and this faith has proven to be well-founded over and over again. At the same time, we’ve found it important to not operate by using assumptions and unproven theories.

## Temporary hierarchy emerges, and is OK

Temporary internal structure will naturally emerge in projects, to suit the group’s needs. People can and often do have clarity around the definition of their “job” on any given day.

They, along with their peers, effectively create a job description that fits the group’s goals. That description changes as requirements change, but the temporary structure provides a shared understanding of what to expect from each other.

If someone moves on, or a team shifts its priorities, each person can take on a completely different role according to the new requirements.

## What if I mess up?

To err is human. You won't get fired for making mistakes. The freedom to
fail is important. We couldn’t expect so much of you, if we penalized
you for errors.

Even expensive mistakes, or ones which result in a very public failure, are looked at as opportunities to learn. We can always repair the mistake, or make up for it.

There are some bad ways to fail. Repeating the same mistake over and over is one. Not listening to customers or peers before or after a failure is another. Never ignore the evidence; particularly when it says you’re wrong.

## Distributed responsibility

Our collective ability to meet challenges, take advantage of opportunity, and respond to threats is far greater when the responsibility for doing so is distributed as widely as possible. Namely, to every individual at the company.

## Crazy transparency

We have what could be called an "uncomfortable level of transparency" — we share information as if everyone is a top manager. We encourage you to share everything that the company is in the legal position to share.

## Performance and compensation

We have two methods of evaluating each other: peer reviews and stack ranking. Peer reviews are done in order to give each other useful feedback on how to best grow as individual contributors. Stack ranking is done primarily as a method of adjusting compensation.

## Peer reviews

We all need feedback about our performance; to improve, and to know we’re not failing. Provide feedback to those around you in realtime, whenever you need to.

## Stack ranking

Our goal is to get your compensation “correct.” Compensation is adjusted based on internal peer-driven valuation. Our desire is to pay people what they’re worth, as best we can tell, using the opinions of peers.

Our peers are the best judges of our value as individuals. Our flat structure eliminates some of the bias that would be present in a peer-ranking system elsewhere. The design of our stack-ranking process is meant to eliminate as much as possible of the remainder.

Each person is asked to rank everyone other than themselves. The categories we chose explicitly state “This is what is valuable.” The categories offer a broad range of ways you can contribute value to the company.

* *Skill Level/Technical Ability* — How difficult and valuable are the kinds of problems you solve? How important/critical of a problem can you be given? Are you uniquely capable (in the company? industry?) of solving a certain class of problem?

* *Productivity/Output* — How much shippable (not necessarily shipped to outside customers), valuable, finished work did you get done?

* *Group Contribution* — How much do you contribute to overall process, hiring, integrating people into the team, improving workflow, amplifying your colleagues, or writing tools used by others? Generally, being a group contributor means that you are making a tradeoff versus an individual contribution.

* *Product Contribution* — How much do you contribute at a larger scope than your core skill? How much did you influence correct prioritization of work or resource trade-offs by others? Are you good customer development? Customer support? Are you good at finding and killing bugs after a launch?

## Be, and hire V-shaped people

Successful, “V-shaped” people are both highly skilled at a broad set of
things, and deep experts within a more narrow discipline. We highly
value “V-shaped” people.

## Hiring

Any time you interview a potential hire, you need to ask yourself not only if they’re talented or collaborative but also if they’re capable of literally running this company, because they will be.

Here are some questions we always ask ourselves when evaluating candidates:

* Would I want this person to be my boss?
* Would I learn a significant amount from him or her?
* What if this person went to work for our competition?
* Does this person seem highly collaborative?
* Is this person stronger than me?
* Do I look forward to grabbing a beer with this person?

When unchecked, people have a tendency to hire others who are lower-powered than themselves. We should hire people more capable than ourselves, not less.

## Work-life balance

Chronically overworking indicates a fundamental failure in planning or communication. It makes you look bad. It’s a sign that something needs to be corrected. Don't look around and wonder why people aren’t in “crunch mode.” We work hard at hiring great people; we encourage healthy work-life balance. We believe that family is number 1, and should be incorporated into your work life, when possible.

## Workplace

Working around your peers is highly encouraged as it allows for better communication and greater collaboration, but it’s not required on a daily basis. Nor are you assigned a daily time to show up and leave. Rather what’s important is that you accomplish great work.

## Vacations

Just like we don’t have a 9-5 policy, we don’t have a vacation policy. You’re valued and assessed on the amount of quality work you produce and contribute to the company and our clients. If you’re producing and contributing great work, it doesn’t matter how many days you spend with your friends and family.

## The system is not perfect

Sometimes our philosophy and methods don’t match perfectly with how things are going day-to-day. Even when problems persist for a while, we will root them out.

We realize that as we continue to grow and scale the team, some of this will be messy. That's OK. We decided on day #1 that the benefits of continuing to be intentional about our culture and philosophy far outweigh the ongoing time investment (and hard conversations) that will be required.

Are some ideals stated here more fully realized than others? What should we do about that? Are the variations a good or bad thing, and a side-effect of experimentation? Or are we drifting towards/away from the ideal culture?

What are you going to do about it? :)

At the end of the day, the user experiences that you decide to create
for customers will define us. We can’t wait to see where you take us.
