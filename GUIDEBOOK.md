## How does the company decide what to work on (beyond client projects)?

The same way we make other decisions: by waiting for someone to decide that it’s
the right thing to do, and then letting them recruit other people to work on it
with them. Or working on it solo.

We believe in each other to make these decisions, and this faith has proven to
be well-founded over and over again.

A few guiding principles:

* Will you enjoy the work?
* Does positively impact our company and community?
* Is it sustainable for the company?

## Who works on what?

The general manager and pod leaders are in place to provide consistency in
leadership for the company, but no formal leadership is established on
a project by project basis.

Temporary internal structure will naturally emerge in projects,
to suit the group’s needs. People can and often do have clarity around
the definition of their “job” on any given day.

They, along with their peers, effectively create a job description that
fits the group’s goals. That description changes as requirements change,
but the temporary structure provides a shared understanding of what to
expect from each other.

If someone moves on, or a team shifts its priorities, each person can
take on a completely different role according to the new requirements.

## What if I mess up?

To err is human. You won't get fired for making mistakes. The freedom to
fail is important. We couldn’t expect so much of you, if we penalized
you for errors.

Even expensive mistakes, or ones which result in a very public failure,
are looked at as opportunities to learn. We can always repair the mistake,
or make up for it.

There are some bad ways to fail. Repeating the same mistake over and over
is one. Not listening to customers or peers before or after a failure
is another. Never ignore the evidence; particularly when it says you’re wrong.

## Hiring

Be, and hire V-shaped people.

Successful, “V-shaped” people are both highly skilled at a broad set of
things, and deep experts within a more narrow discipline. We highly
value “V-shaped” people.

Here are some questions we always ask ourselves when evaluating candidates:

* Would I learn a significant amount from him or her?
* Does this person seem highly collaborative?
* Is this person stronger than me?

When unchecked, people have a tendency to hire others who are lower-powered
than themselves. We should hire people more capable than ourselves, not less.

## Work-life balance

Chronically overworking indicates a fundamental failure in planning
or communication. It makes you look bad. It’s a sign that something
needs to be corrected. Don't look around and wonder why people aren’t
in “crunch mode.” We work hard at hiring great people; we encourage
healthy work-life balance. We believe that family is number 1, and
should be incorporated into your work life, when possible.

## Workplace

Working around your peers is highly encouraged as it allows for better
communication and greater collaboration, but it’s not required on a
daily basis. Nor are you assigned a daily time to show up and leave.
Rather what’s important is that you accomplish great work.

## Vacations

Just like we don’t have a 9-5 policy, we don’t have a vacation policy.
You’re valued and assessed on the amount of quality work you produce and
contribute to the company and our clients. If you’re producing and
contributing great work, it doesn’t matter how many days you spend
with your friends and family. With that, Vacations are important which
is why we expect people to take at least 2 weeks off where they are
completely away from the office.

## The system is not perfect

We realize that as we continue to grow and scale the team,
some of this will be messy. That's OK. The benefits of continuing
to be intentional about our culture and philosophy far outweigh the
ongoing time investment (and hard conversations) that will be required.

Sometimes our philosophy and methods don’t match perfectly with how things are
going day-to-day. It's everyone's responsibility to bring up issues as
they arise, and propose solutions to get us back on track.

At the end of the day, the user experiences that you decide to create
for customers will define us. We can’t wait to see where you take us.
