# DIFFERENTIAL HISTORY

## How we got started

In the fall of 2012, Tim and Ry asked the question "What if you took the 10 ideas and 30 people in a typical accelerator 'class' and combined them into one organization?" They believed it would reduce waste. Through natural selection, some ideas would die quick deaths, and the best few would attract the most talent. And investors would see a better return.

The vision for Differential has evolved some since that original question, but testing this theory is part of that vision.

In 2013, Differential was founded by Tim, Ry, and Gerard as the company we plan to retire from. Our initial mission was to:

* Create a work environment we always dreamed of for ourselves, knowing that if we could make it awesome for us, it would also attract great talent.
* Support entrepreneurs and the Cincinnati startup ecosystem.
* Create long-term value for our investors, our team, and our clients through aligning our interests with our clients by taking some of our compensation in equity.
* Help unlock talented technical folks from their safe jobs by creating opportunities that are less risky than the normal startup proposition.
* Build great products that are solving real problems.
